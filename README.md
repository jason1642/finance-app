# Finance App

## Intro
  This is a single page application that will display stock and company data to the user with a minimalistic design. Currently as of (11/17/2020), the home page displays market overview data, as well as hand picked stock data and general company news. Upon clicking on a stock row, the page will render stock data, a company profile, and company news specific to the symbol provided in the URL.

### Future Plans
  This application currently only uses React as its entire stack. In the future, I will implement Python + Django to allow users to create an account and have specific data displayed on the home page based on their preferences. Any other ideas are welcome.
